JHICCUP_Version=2.0.4
#
# jHiccupLogProcessor will process an input log and can generate two
# different log files from a single jHiccup histogram log file: a
# sequential interval log file and a histogram log file.
#
# The sequential interval log file logs a single %'ile stats line for
# each reporting interval.
#
# The histogram percentile log file includes a detailed %'ile histogram
# of the entire log file range.
#
# jHiccupLogProcessor will process an input log file when provided with
# the -i <filename> option. When no -i option is provided, standard input
# will be processed.
#
# When provided with an output file name <logfile> with the -o option
# (e.g. "-o mylog"), jHiccupLogProcessor will produce both output files
# under the names <logfile> and <logfile>.hgrm (e.g. mylog and mylog.hgrm).
#
# When not provided with an output file name, jHiccupLogProcessor will
# produce [only] the histogram percentile log output to standard output.
#
# jHiccupLogProcessor accepts optional -start and -end time range
# parameters. When provided, the output will only reflect the portion
# of the input log with timestamps that fall within the provided start
# and end time range parameters.
#
# jHiccupLogProcessor also accepts and optional -csv parameter, which
# will cause the output formatting (of both output file forms) to use
# a CSV file format.

# Figure out installed path:
# On Linux, we'd do the following:
# PARSED_SCRIPT=`readlink -f $0`
# INSTALLED_PATH=`dirname $PARSED_SCRIPT`
# But readlink -f doesn't work the same everywhere (e.g. Mac OS). We use this instead:
function readlink_f () { _=`pwd`; cd `dirname $1` && echo `pwd` && cd $_; }
INSTALLED_PATH=$(readlink_f $0)

# Check if running from unpacked distribution archive by assuming jHiccup.jar
# in the same directory as this script. If not, try to search in target/ directory
# (running from the source repository build).
